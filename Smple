Prompt Asked in the context of Land Dispute and Case Status:
Below are the points i want to put it in clear 1)After purchasing the land from L.Swamy legal heirs in august 2007 by JV Subba Rao in total of 6Acres 13Guntas . JV Subba Rao approached Joint Collector to investigate 13b certificates are valid or not and Joint collector order came on May 2009 2)JV Subba Rao approached MRO in the year 2013 by showing Irrecoverable GPA with possession and Joint Collector Order after few days Nirupa Rani [owner from 2004 who purchased land from chakali satyanarayana , laksminarayana ,pentamma] filed a writ petition for 2.26 guntas land not completely 6.13 3) I posted affadivit as well above on what basis Nirupa Rani approached High Court as a petitioner and included JV Subba Rao as respondents and others as well 4) In 2014 court has suspended joint collector orders interim basis [am not sure what exaclty it is] 5) Till that day case status is pending Till above I believe you understand the context what happened so far but I did investigation on my own I figured out few points i.e 6) Without sending notices or informing JV Subba Rao Legal heirs executed cancellation deed in the August 2009 and very next day they sold land to P.Shrisailam(3 acres) ,Raminneni ShekarSai (3acres), Shoyapat Godra(13Guntas) 7) In 2010 again P.Shrisailam(3 acres) sold 3 acres land to Shatrugan Agarwal 8) In 2011 Shoyapat godra sold 13 Guntas land to Shatrugan Agarwal 9) At present If I search in Telangana land search portal Shekar Sai(3acres) and Shatrugan Agarwal(3acres.13guntas) are in position but status it is showing Case Status pending so from 2009 ShekarSai is in possession of 3 acres and from 2010 Shatrugan Agarwal is in possession of 3acres.13guntas in position . but you are telling more than 12 years these people are in possession it is illegal or legal ? One Mistake JV Subba Rao did is he got registered based on Irrecoverable GPA with possession and he didn't known that legal heirs cancellation deed executed Tell me your understanding the whole context from Nirupa Rani Affidavit, Joint Collector Order issued to my uncle in 2009 and interim Court order suspension which was given in the year 2014? now tell me in step-by-step in detail how to approach further, key points to discuss with Lawyer by studying thoroughly from the below points ? Below is the Joint Collector Order you can check crystal clear Joint collector has sent notices to initial respondents (Chakali Satyanarayana ,Laksminarayana,Pentamma) who fabricated land documents based on 13B certificate . Now ask is Nirupa rani mentioned in affidavit that she was not involved but my question even she does not have rights to be part of the case may be joint collector didn't sent notices to her though she has pattedar passbook that pattedar passbook also came from Yellagoni Pentamma W/o Yadaiah2.Chakali Satyanarayana S/o Pentaiah3.Chakali Laxminarayana 1Date: 22.05.2009.No. F3/4770/2008 - F3/42/ROR12008GOVERNMENT QF ANDW-FSHIN THE COURT OF THE JOINT CIOLLECTQRNEDT SANGAREDDY.PRESENT: Rama Sankarai1/4taik, No. F3/4770/2008 - F3/42/ROR12008.Between:1.Lagula Manohar S/o Jangaiah2.L.Bheemaiah S/o Jangaiah3.L.Ramulu S/o Jangaiah4.L.Laxman S/o JangaiahR/o H.No: 1-62, Nandigama (V) Patancheru (M) Medak District.5.Smt.Mujahithipuram Pushpamma W/o YadaiahRio H.No:

ROR in Land and Pattedar Pass Books Act, 1971 by Sri Lagula Manohar S/o Jangaiah and (6) others through their G.P. Attorney cum agreement of sale Dt.30.08.2007 namely Jagarlamudi Venkata Subba Rao S/o late Radhakrishna Murthy Rio Rachapudi Post: Addanki, Kousapadu (M) Prakasham District in respect of land in Sy.No: 256 admeasuring Ac.6.13 gts., situated at Nandigama (V) Patancheru (M) Medak District against the 13-B certificate issued by the MRO in file No: F/3897/94 and F/3896/94 in favour of the respondent No: 1 and also the respondents No: 2 and 3.The brief facts of the case as stated by the revision petitioners are that one Bhooma Goud was the PT over the land in Sy.No: 251, 252 and 256 admeasuring Ac.10.23 gts., Ac.11.31 gts., and Ac.6.13 gts., respectively situated at Nandigama (V) Patancheru (M) Medak District. After the death of Bhooma Goud his only son L.Swamy succeeded the property U/s 40 of Tenancy Act and 38-E certificate was granted in favour of L.Swamy on 14.5.1985 and his name was incorporated in revenue records as owner and possessor. Subsequently the said Swamy died leaving behind him his two wives namely Gangamma and Basamma and their names have been incorporated in revenue records. It is further stated that the first wife has no issues and whereas the second wife is having four daughters. The first daughter died leaving behind her four sons namely Lagula Mogulaiah, Bheemaiah, Ramulu and Laxman (revision petitioners 1 to 4) and they are peaceful possession and enjoyment of the land. 2•No. F3/4770/2008 - F3/42/R0R/2008It is stated that recently they executed a registered GPA of attorney cum agreement of sale with possession of their GPA holder Venkata Subba Rao on 30.08.2007 and since then Venkata Subba Rao is in exclusive possession and enjoyment of the property. On 15.4.2008 the revision petitioners came to know that the respondents falsely claimed that they are concerned with the property as they have obtained 13-B certificate from the MRO Patancheru. Immediately they obtained the copy of 13-B certificate said to have been issued in favour of the respondents 2 and 3 in respect of the land in Sy.No: 256 admeasuring Ac.5.13 gts., of Nandigama (V). They further stated that out of the area in Sy.No: 256 for Ac.1.00 gts., of land 13-B certificate was issued in favour of respondent No: I . They further stated that L.Swamy never sold the land in favour of any body as per the 13-B certificates it is revealed that sale deeds are fabricated by the respondents and obtained 13-B certificates behind the back of the original pattedars._ _Moreo—v—er it is stated that the so called alienation in the year 1973 is through an invalid document and that as per the revenue record the respondents were never possession or enjoyment in property any point of time more particularly from 1973 onwards and as per the revenue records the land was in possession of L.Swamy. Moreover the said L.Swamy has no power to sell the property before getting ownership certificate i.e., 38-E certificate under Tenancy Act. It is also stated that as per tenancy act

 U/s 48-A the person who obtains certificate U/s 38-E is prohibited from alienating the property for a period of (8) years from the date of obtaining 38-E certificate and that the MRO without verifying the revenue records and tenancy reegister etc., and rule position has issued the 13-B certificate which has no legal sanctity.The revision petitioner finally requested to allow the revision while setting aside the orders passed by the MRO Patancheru in file No: F/3897/94 and F/3896/94 in which 13-B certificate were issued to respondents 1, 2 and 3 in respect of land in Sy.No: 256 admeasuring Ac.1.00 gts., and Ac.5.13 gts., respectively in the interest of justice and equity.In response to the revision notices were issued to respondents 1, 2 and 3 with a direction to appear before this authority on 18.09.2008. The notices issued to the respondents and which was sent by registered post with acknowledgement due were returned with an endorsement that they refused to take the notice.However even after the return of the notices the case was posted on 16.10.2008, 6.11.2008 and 20.11.2008. -On all these occasions the respondents called absent.On 20.11.2008 the counsel for revision petitioners requested to set the respondents ex-parte and decide the case as per records while filing written arguments. Accordingly the respondents herein are set ex-parte as they have refused to receive the notices issued to them to defend their case.Perused the records.In the written arguments the main plea that was taken by the counsel for revision petitioners is that the purported sale deed said to have been executed by late L.Swamy on 15.05.1973 based on which the 13-B certificates were issued in favour of respondents No. 1, 2 and 3 is false and fabricated. It is further contended that as on that date the Lagula Swamy was only a protected tenant who has no right at all to alienate the property. The counsel 3Joint Collector :: Medak.Joint CoPector. Metialc Dist. SangareHrivNo. F3/4770/2008 - F3/42/ROR/2008further pleaded that U/s 48-A of Tenancy Act even a person in whose favour the 38-E certificate was issued is prohibited from permanent alienation of the property for a period of (8) years from the date of issuing of 38-E certificate and that in this instant case the said Lagula Swamy was given 38-E certificate on 14.05.1985 vide RDO file No: C2/1231/74 as LR of late Bheema Goud, Thus even if the said Lagula Swamy intends to alienate the property permanently he has to wait upto 14.05.1993 whereas the purported plain paper is dt.15.05.1973 which has no legal sanctity in the eye of law. He requested to allow the revision and set aside the impugned 13-B certificates issued by the MRO Patancheru in file No: F/3897/1994 and F/3896/94 dated:29.09.1994.After having gone through the material papers and the rule position I am inclined to agree with the contention of the revision petitioners herein. In the result the 13-B certificates issued by MRO Patancheru vide file No: F/3897/1994 and F/3896/94 dated:29.09.1994 are set aside and the revision petition is allowed. Further the Tahsildar, Patancheru is directed to record the name of the GPA attorney cum agreement sale holder Jagarlamudi Venkata Subba Rao S/o late RadhaRrishna Murthy in respect of the land in Sy.No: 256 admeasuring Ac.6.13 gts., situated at Nandigama (V) Patancheru (M) Medak District.Got typed to my dictation, corrected and pronounced in the Open Court on this the 22nd Day of May, 2009.To1.Lagula Manohar S/o Jangaiah2.L.Bheemaiah S/o Jangaiah3.L.Ramulu S/o Jangaiah4.L.Laxman S/o JangaiahR/o H.No: 1-62, Nandigama (V) Patancheru (M) Medal( District.5.Smt.Mujahithipuram Pushpamma W/o YadaiahR/o H.No: 1-141, Lingampalli, Rangareddy District.6.K.Amruthamma W/o Mogulappa7.Aliva Prabhavathi

Copy to S.F. Writ petition filed by Nirupa Rani Below is the Affadivit Please find below AFFIDAVIT I, Smt.Karike Niruparani, W/o K.Satyanarayana, aged about 40 yrs, occ: House wife, R/o H.No.11-100, Srinivasa Colony, Ramachandrapuram village and mandal, Medak District, having temporarily come down to Hyderabad, 'do hereby solemn!y and sincerely state on oath as follows: I submit that I am petitioner herein and as such I am well acquainted with the facts of the case. I submit that in the present writ petition I am questioning the order of the 2nd respondent in allowing a revision filed by the respondent Nos.4 to 11 U/sec.9 of A.P.ROR in Land and Pattedar Pass Books, Act, 1971 as illegal, arbitrary, in violation of principles of natural justice, contrary to the provisions of the Act and without jurisdiction. 3. I respectfully submit that I have purchased a land to an extent of Ac.2.08 gts on a sale consideration of Rs.70,000/- in Sy.No.256/a in Nandigama village, Patancheru mandal, Medak District from the respondent Nos.9 & 11. The respondent Nos.9 & 10 are the brothers and sons of late Pentaiah and the respondent. No.11 is the son of Respondent No.9. In the division of property in between themselves, the respondent Nos.9 and 11 have inherited the property which was sold to me. 4. I respectfully submit that I have purchased the said land on 25.3.2004 by way of a registered sale and on an application to the Tahsildar, i.e., respondent No.3 and after due enquiry, the Pattedar Passbooks and Title deeds were issued in my favour on 22.3.2005. Till today I am in peaceful and continuous possession of the land and eking out my livelihood on the same. While this was so, to my utter shock and surprise some persons have approached the land on 25th July, 2013, stating that they are the owners of the land and therefore I have to vacate the land. However, the said attempt was resisted by me and on enquiry I came to know that the persons are the agents of respondent Nos.4 to 11. Immediately I approached the concerned authorities and to my shock and surprise it was informed to me that the Adangal/Pahani has been changed and some third person's name i.e., Ramineni Shekar Saibaba/respondent No.16 has been included for the year 2012-13. It was also informed to me by the officials of the ' respondent that some proceedings took place inter-se in between the respondent Nos.4 to 15 before the 2nd respondent and there is alleged to have been an order obtained as against the respondent Nos.11 to 14 dated 22.5.2009 vide No.F3/4770/2008-F3/42/ROR/2008. 5) I respectfully submil til immediately I have approached the za. respondent/Joint Collector and obtained the order. A perusal of the order shows that an application is alleged to have been filed u/sec.9 of the A.P. Pattedar Passbooks Act, 1971 and a notice is alleged to have been issued to the respondent

 Nos.11 to 14 and as there was no response, they were set exparte and the revision was decided in favour of the revision petitioners. Mr.Chakali Satyanarayana, who is my vendor is also a party to the proceedings and remained exparte and therefore I become an affected party. 6) I respectfully submit that a perusal of the impugned order shows that the 2"d i respondent passed an order setting aside the certificates issued u/sec.13 (b) of Telangana Tenancy Act in favour of Smt.Pentamma by the 3rd respondent dated 29.9.1994 and consequently directed to record the name of the 4" respondent. The said order is without any reasoning or any basis and contrary to the facts and law. 7) I respectfully submit that the order passed by the 2nd respondent is without any jurisdiction. Section 9 of the Pattedar Passbook Act confers power on the District Collector to call for the records only if any order is passed contrary to the Act under sections 3, 5, 5(A) Or S(B) of the Pattedar Passbook Act alone., Section 9 of the Act does not empower the 2nd respondent to pass an order setting aside the proceedings passed in some other enactment i.e., Telangana Tenancy Act in this case. The order passed by the 2"d respondent is clearly erroneous and without jurisdiction. 8) I respectfully submii that 13 (b) certificate is issued under the Tenancy Act and therefore the 2 respondent acting under the Pattedar Passbook Act, 1971 has no jurisdiction or power to entertain any such grievance as made out by the revision petitioner therein and pass orders as in the impugned proceedings. More over the proceedings under the Telangana Tenancy Act have become final and no appeal is. filed by any. of the aggricved parties on the same. Therefore the 2"d respondent has passed the order without any power or jurisdiction by giving irrelevant and illegal findings. Therefore the impugned rder is liable to be set aside. 9. I respectfully submit that my name is entered in the possessor's column upto the year 2010 and only in the year 2011-12 the narne of the respondent No.16 has been entered without recording any proceedings. I continue to be in possession and no notice was issued or served on me even though I am an affected party, the impugned proceeding is liable to be set aside on the ground of violation of principles of natural justice. Unless this Hon'ble High Court comes to the rescue, the respondents ure bound to violate my valuable rights under the guise of the illegal order passed by the 2" respondent and if the same is done, I would be put to great irreparable hardship and injury: I reiterate that I am in continuous and peaceful possession of the property. I submit that in the circumstances stated above, the Petitioner has no efficacious alternative remedy, except to approach this Hon'ble Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. I submit that the Petitioner has not filed any writ petition, suit or other proceedings for the relief or relieves sought herein. . It is therefore prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to issue a Writ, Order or Direction more particularly one in the nature of Writ of Mandamus declaring. the impugned proceeding No.F3/4770/2008-F3/42/ROR/2008 dated 22.5.2009 passed by the 2' respondent as illegal, arbitrary, without jurisdiction and consequently direct the 3d respondent to re-enter the name of the petitioner in the revenue records and pass such other order or orders as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the intelest of justice. It is further prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to grant interim suspension of the impugned proceeding No.F3/4770/2008-F3/42/ROR/2008 dated 22.5.2009 passed by the 2" respondent, pending disposal of the above writ petition and pass such other order or

 orders as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the interest of justice. Sworn and signed before me on this the 11* day of August, 2013 at lyderabad.

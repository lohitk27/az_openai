Key Contributions Over the Last 6-7 Months:
	1.	Implemented, tested, and validated various LLM models, including Azure OpenAI GPT-based models, prebuilt models, Azure OpenAI embeddings, Azure Text Translator, and AWS Bedrock models (Claude, Haiku, Mistral) via the Gateway Dashboard.
	2.	Provided project-based access to users by managing API keys within the Gateway Dashboard.
	3.	Created and managed projects for both onshore and offshore teams based on their specific requirements.
	4.	Resolved day-to-day issues related to LLM model access for both onshore and offshore users.
	5.	Set up environments for respective projects based on their objectives and technical requirements.

Future Task Alignment:

The tasks currently assigned for the next three months are primarily related to the DevOps stack, which does not align with my core expertise in GenAI and AI/ML. I would like to focus on areas where I can bring more value within a shorter timeframe. Specifically, I am interested in tasks related to:
	•	Fine-tuning and optimizing LLM models for specific use cases.
	•	Enhancing model evaluation frameworks for better performance monitoring.
	•	Exploring and implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architectures.
	•	Developing AI-driven solutions that align with business objectives.

I believe aligning my responsibilities with my expertise in GenAI/AI-ML will allow me to contribute more effectively and drive better outcomes for the team. Please let me know your thoughts on this.

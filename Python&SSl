Here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to install Python and set up an SSL certificate (.pem file) using the certifi library. The guide is designed for beginners, so anyone can follow it easily.

Step 1: Install Python

1.1 Download Python
	•	Open a web browser and go to the official Python website:
https://www.python.org/downloads/
	•	Click on “Download Python” (the latest stable version will be selected automatically).

1.2 Install Python
	•	Open the downloaded .exe file.
	•	Check the box that says “Add Python to PATH” (Important).
	•	Click Install Now and wait for the installation to complete.
	•	Once installed, open Command Prompt (cmd) and type:

python --version

This should display the installed Python version.

Step 2: Install pip (if not installed)
	•	Open Command Prompt and type:

python -m ensurepip --default-pip


	•	To verify pip installation, run:

pip --version

You should see an output like:

pip 23.0.1 from C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.9)

Step 3: Install the certifi Library
	•	The certifi package provides a certificate authority (CA) bundle for SSL/TLS connections.
	•	Install it using pip:

pip install certifi

Step 4: Download and Set Up SSL .pem File

4.1 Locate the certifi CA Bundle Path
	•	Open Python’s interactive shell by typing in the terminal:

python


	•	Run the following command inside Python:

import certifi
print(certifi.where())

This will output the path of the cacert.pem file, typically:

C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\lib\site-packages\certifi\cacert.pem



4.2 Replace or Update the .pem File
	•	If you have a custom .pem file, replace the existing cacert.pem file with your .pem file.
	•	If you want to add additional certificates, open cacert.pem in a text editor and append your .pem certificate at the end.

Step 5: Set Environment Variable (Optional)
	•	If you want Python to use your custom .pem file, set an environment variable.
	•	Open Command Prompt and run:

set SSL_CERT_FILE=C:\path\to\your\custom_cert.pem


	•	To make this permanent:
	1.	Search for “Environment Variables” in Windows.
	2.	Click Edit the system environment variables.
	3.	Under System Properties, go to Environment Variables.
	4.	Click New and add:
	•	Variable name: SSL_CERT_FILE
	•	Variable value: C:\path\to\your\custom_cert.pem
	5.	Click OK and restart your computer.

Step 6: Test SSL Connection
	•	Run this Python script to test if SSL works correctly:

import requests
response = requests.get("https://www.google.com", verify=True)
print(response.status_code)


	•	If SSL is correctly set up, it should return:

200

which means the connection is successful.

Troubleshooting
	1.	SSL Certificate Error?
	•	Ensure certifi is installed properly:

pip install --upgrade certifi


	•	Run this command to update the CA bundle:

import ssl
print(ssl.get_default_verify_paths())


	2.	Python Not Found in CMD?
	•	Ensure Python is added to PATH.
	•	Run:

python --version


	•	If Python is not recognized, reinstall Python and check “Add Python to PATH” during installation.

Summary of Steps

✅ Install Python
✅ Install pip
✅ Install certifi
✅ Locate cacert.pem file
✅ Replace or update .pem file
